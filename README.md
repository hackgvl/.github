This is a "special" repository used to customize the [main GitHub organization for HackGreenville Labs](https://github.com/hackgvl/), as defined in the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/customizing-your-organizations-profile).

If you found yourself here and don't know why, then hit "reset" by reaching out in the #hg-labs channel in the [HackGreenville Slack](https://hackgreenville.com/join-slack).
