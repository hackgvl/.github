## HackGreenville Labs on GitHub
GitHub is the primary source of code and project management for the projects supported by [HackGreenville Labs](https://hackgreenville.com/labs).

Some of these projects were originally developed by the group formerly known as Code For Greenville.

## Where Do I Start?
* Contribute to our open issues, including ["Good First Issues"](https://github.com/orgs/hackgvl/projects/2).
* We do not currently have regularly scheduled meetings, so reach out in the _#hg-labs_ channel in the [HackGreenville Slack](https://hackgreenville.com/join-slack).

## What Else?
* The "Pinned" repositories on this page represent our most active projects.
* View our [Project Views](https://github.com/orgs/hackgvl/projects) for curated visualizations of active and upcoming tasks.
* Review our [Suggestions and Ideas](https://github.com/orgs/hackgvl/projects/7) before sharing new feature requests.
* Pull requests require at least 1 review by any active Labs member with relevant experience.
  * Permissions to merge PRs are defined on a per repository basis
  * Ask in the #hg-labs channel if it's unclear who would be best to review or merge your PR
